## Overview

The aim of the game is to get as many huippises to participate in as many team activities as possible!
Huippises are natually attracted to beer that a make-it-happener (controlled by the player) can distribute around the level.
On the other hand, one thing huippises hate most is the infamous "Party" coffee (as it is notorious for its disgusting taste and even more horrible stomach cramps). Those can be spawned by the player as well, which will cause huippises to run away from it at increasing speed. Finally, Jaloviina is an inherent danger for huippises and kills them immediately after the first contact.

While the goal is to attract as many huippises to the activiies as possible, the time is limited. Besides, the amount of points gived for completing a single activity increases exponentially, so it makes sense to move fast and not necessarily wait for all the huippises!
